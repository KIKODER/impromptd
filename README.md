## FAQ

### What is Imprompt'd?
Imprompt'd is a single-player web game that generates custom Mad Libs-style stories using AI. Users fill in various word types (like adjectives and nouns), and the AI crafts a unique story based on their inputs.

### How does it work?
The app uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end, and a Node.js/Express server on the back end. It connects to the OpenAI API to generate stories dynamically based on user-supplied words.

### Do I need an OpenAI API key to run this?
Yes. To run the project locally, youâ€™ll need to create a `.env` file in the root directory with your own `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

### Can this app be used by multiple users at the same time?
Currently, the app is designed for a single user experience per session. Multiplayer or shared usage is not supported yet.

### Why is the project called "Imprompt'd"?
Based on the word "impromptu", meaning "-done without being planned, organized, or rehearsed." I wanted to incorporate a word that properly describes the unique, spontaneous nature of this project.
